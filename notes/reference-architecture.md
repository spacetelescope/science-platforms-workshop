Reference architecture

- Common way to distribute software?
- Could potentially solve a lot of problems by just using containers
  - A container is a good way of doing that
- Containers improve the portability of an astronomer’s work between environments
  - Reduces vendor lock in?
- Are we really moving away from Conda?
  - No. There are complex tools that are better delivered by containers.
  - Let’s not make it the only way to install software! (as this hurts software compatibility)
- Container catalogs/registries
- Something that should be appealing to scientists should be reproducibility.
  - Timescale for which we have containers is limited.
- How many people are building what essentially matches what Frossie has drawn?
- A goal might be to lower cost for other centers
  - Do we want reference implementations of reference architectures?
- What is the correct term for the ‘notebook aspect’ of a science platforms
  - What is allowed to be in the box.
