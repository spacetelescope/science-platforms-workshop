* Alternative title: VO vs a more ‘open source way’
* Are collaborations inherently less open than standards bodies?
* Astropy is an ‘open collaboration’
* Interoperability requires collaboration too!
* Generating standards (for interoperability) is hard and takes time.
* Which situations lend themselves better to one vs the other?
* Standards seems more ‘top down’, the other is more ‘bottom up’
* This group (science platforms) should deliver priorities to IVOA.
* IVOA did not focus on software to implement the standards. Did not set up open source repository for example.
* Code is written, generalized, standards can emerge from implementers
* In some cases, standards can be best refined by iterative development with feedback from implementations
   * This happens sometimes
   * TAP did not work like this
* Can community packages abstract some of the messiness of standards development
* Most astronomers don’t realize they’re using the VO (even though they’re using it?)
   * VO has a branding problem
* “Please don’t make my funder tell me what standard to use”
* Interoperability - the goal is to make it easy for the end user.
* Role of data center is to present data in form that everyone has agreed upon (even if that data representation has been decided by e.g. Astropy/Astroquery)
* Some standards are inherently complex. Role of client libraries is to make it easy for the end user (astronomer)
* VO is not a tool for astronomers, it’s a tool for data centers. Astropy is a tool for astronomers, not data centers.
   * E.g. ESASky is using VO throughout. Every user of Gaia data is using the VO.
* One of the problems with VO’s branding issue is that people expect the VO to have a brand (!) - it’s plumbing/core infrastructure and not a product with a ‘brand’
* How does the VO work:?
   * e.g. is consensus a requirement? (yes)
   * No management entity.
   * Once a standard is blessed, it’s then up to the data centers to follow the standards (if they want to)
* What if funders mandated the implementation of standards?
   * Without a mandate, there’s no feedback loop from implementers to standards bodies (e.g. IVOA)
* Funding agencies do care about how data are released
   * Don’t want a huge burden on the PIs
   * Want implementers to help funders understand what’s important.
   * NASA have supported VO standards (and continue to). NAVO review happens regularly.
* VO has a major branding problem in the US (and to a lesser extent in the UK).
   * One of the reasons is there was significant funding - this resulted in overselling of the idea/promise. Led to claims that disappointed people.
   * Science platforms are plumbing - let’s not oversell this idea. “Always under-promise and over-deliver.”
   * We don’t have to spin it.
* Standards bodies need good feedback from data centers (and other implementers). Participate in the process of developing standards.
   * If you work in isolation then you shouldn’t have the expectation of a standard working well for you!
* What is the preferred way of providing feedback to the IVOA?
   * Idea of IVOA is that they attend core meetings and be involved in community discussions/events.
* Engineers are doing the actual building, a strong engineering representation in these discussions is important.
* Discussion today has not considered large collaborations.
   * ...except there are lots of individuals too!
