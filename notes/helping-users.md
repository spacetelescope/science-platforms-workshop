# Helping Users

## Help Desk

* [Data Lab Help Desk](http://datalab.noao.edu/help/) uses [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org/).
  - Data Lab staff can ask questions as placeholders for an eventual FAQ.
* So many questions you can't answer them?
  - Data Lab Help Desk is a user forum format, so users can answer questions as well as ask them.
  - Create examples, FAQ, point most questions there.
  - Track how many times the forum is visited?
    - Maybe have to get this from the underlying web server, if not Question2Answer itself.
  - Ability to upvote answers, though this hasn't really been applied yet.
* [SciServer Help System](http://www.sciserver.org/support/help/) has links to help for individual tools.
  - Users can submit problems via a [form](http://www.sciserver.org/support/bug-report-and-suggestion-form/) which connects to in-house RT ticket system.
* SDSS just uses an (archived) mailing list.
  - Some problems get escalated to internal bug tracking system, or reported to another mailing list.
  - Public users are not necessarily notified that bug reports are created.

## Ticket System

* Data Lab had planned to set up JIRA as a ticket system, but this hasn't happened yet.
  - The team triages incoming questions, but this is not a formal process.
  - Could have Question2Answer generate an email that would be sent to, parsed by JIRA.
* Data Lab uses [TargetProcess](https://www.targetprocess.com/) for workflow control.
  - Some items can be tagged as bugs.

## Best Practices

* A User Forum is a good idea.
* A Ticket System is a good idea.
* A Triage Point person (or people) with some actual power is a good idea.
  - Need to have the power to rattle expert's cages to get an answer.
  - Don't let a question turn into an open-ended research project.
  - Watch out for spam, phishing, etc.
* Working the help desk should be considered a volunteer activity.
  - Unless you actually have the budget to specifically pay, *e.g.*, 10% of someone's salary.
* If your institution already has a system, don't create a separate one.
* Tickets and Help Desk Questions should be archived and logged.
  - Archive/logs should be *searchable*.

## Questions Going Forward

* Can we share data on number of users versus number of FTE working on user support?
* Are there established standards in the community?
  - For example, does IVOA have a support system?
    - Grid and Web Services?
